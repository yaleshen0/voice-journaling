## Quick workflow overview

1. A contributor **forks** the `template/` repo (or clicks *Use this template* on GitHub).  
2. They implement their feature following `template/README.md` and make sure `pnpm lint && pnpm test` are both green.  
3. They generate a `patch.diff` or simply share the repository URL in the designated Issue.  
4. You run `scripts/verify-contrib.sh <repo-url>` to clone the repo and execute the automated checks offline.  
5. If it passes and looks valuable, you manually cherry-pick / copy the code into the main code-base.

> Important: everything lives under the `contrib/` sub-directory
